EVERYTHING HERE IS FOR MAC, Windows is probably really similar except for dowloading git for the contributers

To the non contributers who need the code to be downloaded

Download the Code with VEXCode Pro V5.
  1. On github click on code. Then click on download zip. Then unzip
  2. Download VEXCode Pro V5 here: https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode/pro-v5?srsltid=AfmBOop742TCUABI4j4PcAUUs_M-51-791SLOUhRivjPB3q4HghmKPbi
  3. Ignore the replaced by VS code extention, unless you know how to use VS code with vex.
  4. Open VEXCode Pro V5 and click on "file," then "open" and navigate to the unzipped folder you downloaded from git hub. Open the folder and click on the file with the .v5code file extension.
  5. Then plug in the controller or the brain to your computer via USB. Sometimes the controller can be finickey so if you can plug into the brain, it is more reliable.
  7. When the brain icon turns green on the upper left hand of the code, click the download button.
  8. You can change the file slot by clicking on the number to the left of the red VEXCode Pro V5 icon at the top center of the application.
